Currently, Quick Ride operates in major Indian cities such as Delhi-NCR, Mumbai, Bangalore, Pune, Kolkata, Chennai, Hyderabad, Kochi and Trivandrum.
What is carpooling?
Carpooling or ride-sharing is nothing but sharing empty seats in your car with other commuters who are travelling on the same route. Carpooling can be done with your friends, colleagues or anybody whom you meet through ride-sharing apps such as Quick Ride. Car sharing is a very simple concept that reduces the overall cost of commuting and also helps to reduce traffic congestion and carbon emissions.
Quick Ride is the best carpooling app in India, and it has played a pivotal role in Delhi-NCR during the Delhi odd-even rule. Sharing rides has also helped to control the level of vehicular pollution in the national capital.
Benefits of carpooling/bike pooling
Ride-sharing saves your travel expenses as you share the fuel costs with your co-riders.

Outstation carpool will reduce traffic on the highways and prevent carbon emissions.
Carpool an alternative to Taxi/Cab

Searching for an investment property and value someone’s opinion or real estate expertise? Invite them to shortlist with you for a little extra help along the way.
Don’t miss out
Property never sleeps, but you do. Luckily Domain stays on top of things for you, notifying you when big things happen to the real estate you care about. Save your favourite searches and we’ll let you know when new properties land that match your criteria. Shortlist something and we’ll keep you updated if the price changes or if it goes under offer.

Search however you want to

Whatever you decide, this is your property search, so put your stamp on it by filtering down to exactly what you’re looking for. Whether you’re after your next family home or just the right piece of real estate to invest in, tell us what to show you in terms of price, bedrooms, bathrooms, surrounding suburbs and so much more. Save your search and Domain will remember it for you so you won’t have to re-apply those filters again.
Your inspections, already organised
Want to see a property in person? Tap “Add to Planner” and Domain will automatically organise the details for you in your Inspection Planner. View your upcoming inspections in a neat timeline and weigh in afterwards so we can guide you through the next steps, like requesting a contract or getting in touch with the real estate agent.

Want to know which suburbs are best to buy or invest in? Doing your market and price research is easy with our competitive real estate tools.

When you’re nearing the end of your property journey, we’re still right by your side with tools like our Monthly Repayment and Stamp Duty calculators that will help you anticipate upfront costs. Trying to organise the kids’ school? We’ll show you which school catchment zones your new property falls in, and how close it is to other places you often commute to.

20 million families
around the world have chosen
Alfred Camera
to secure their home. We are the world's most popular and top-rated app for home security.
SECURITY CAMERA FOR THE SMARTPHONE AGE
People love Alfred Camera! The all-in-one app provides more features than a basic, expensive security camera. You can get live stream, motion detector, night vision, walkie-talkie, and siren to deter intruders.
VERSATILE
If you want a CCTV or IP webcam to keep an eye on your belongings, a baby monitor to look after your newborn, or a dog monitor to entertain your lovely pets, Alfred Camera is the best choice!
EASY TO SET UP
DIY your own home security camera in 3 minutes. No cost, no hard skills; just one old phone! Alfred Camera is the easiest-to-install smart home solution.
ANYTIME, ANYWHERE
You don’t need a security guard to defend your front door and backyard! Alfred will take care of what matters the most. Unlike a traditional CCTV camera or IP webcam, you can put Alfred wherever you need to strengthen home security.
If you rent an apartment, you might want to make sure that your landlord or roommate doesn’t enter your room without permission. When you travel, you might want to make sure your hotel room is safe. In either case, you need a portable video camera that lets you zoom in or turn on night vision mode to see the details.
SIMPLE SECURITY AT YOUR FINGERTIPS
With crystal clear live stream, you'll always know exactly what's going on, no matter where you are. Additionally, Alfred's motion detector will send you an instant alert when it detects an intruder. You can scare the intruder away by speaking through the walkie-talkie immediately. The auto-recorded videos will be kept in a free and unlimited cloud storage. You can download them and use them as evidence to help identify the suspect.
FEATURES
Alfred Camera has all of the standard features of a home security camera, along with the following:
• 24/7 LIVE STREAM: Watch the high-quality live video from anywhere.
• MOTION DETECTOR: Get instant alert when the camera picks up any movement.
• CLOUD STORAGE: Playback, download, and share your video footage at any time.
• NIGHT VISION: Reinforce security when it's dark.
• WALKIE-TALKIE: Deter thieves, interact with visitors or pets, and soothe babies.
• ZOOM, SIREN and more...
SMART, CONVENIENT
First time choosing a CCTV or IP camera? Still hoping to find good reviews on an expensive baby monitor or dog monitor? You can protect your home with this smart home solution. You don’t even need to buy a real CCTV camera, baby monitor, IP camera, or IP webcam.
Besides the cost of the equipment, these smart home appliances often charge a monthly fee. With security apps like Alfred, there is no complicated installation, IP settings, or contract. You only have to download Alfred to repurpose your old devices as a DIY WiFi Camera or baby monitor: pure and simple.
Alfred Camera can also be used as a parental control device. You can easily help your kids settle arguments by talking through the walkie-talkie, zoom in to see if they’re doing their homework or playing video games, and you can get crystal clear images by switching to night vision mode when they sleep.
Everyone is taking advantage of their unused smartphones by turning them into a walkie-talkie, parental control device, or video camera. So why not use yours as a baby monitor, night vision device, dog monitor, webcam or IP camera?

How it works
Most aircraft today are equipped with ADS-B transponders that transmit positional data. Flightradar24 has a rapidly growing network of over 20,000 ground stations around the world to receive this data that then shows up as aircraft moving on a map in the app. In an expanding number of regions, with the help of multilateration, we’re able to calculate the positions of aircraft that don’t have ADS-B transponders. Coverage in North America is also supplemented by real-time radar data. Coverage is variable and subject to change at any time.

181,Where is my Train : Indian Railway Train Status,"""Where is my Train"" is a unique train app that displays live train status and up-to-date schedules. The app can function offline without needing Internet or GPS.  It is also packed with useful features such as destination alarms and a speedometer. It is the
highest rated travel app in India
. Thank you to all the users who make the app better every day by sharing their feedback with us.
Why this app is the highest rated train app?
Spotting Train Accurately
Get live train status of Indian Railways anytime, anywhere. When you are traveling on a train, this feature can work without internet or GPS as it uses cell tower information to find the location. You can share current train location with your friends & family via the share feature. You can also set an alarm to wake you up at a fixed time before your railway station arrives.
Offline Train Schedules
The train app has the Indian Railways timetable offline. You don't have to know train number or names as our Smart search feature allows you to use train source & destination or partial train names even with spelling errors.
Coach Layout and Platform numbers
Get information on coach position and seat/berth layout before you board the train. Also shows platform numbers for boarding and intermediate stations wherever available.
Super efficient in Battery, Data Usage and App size
The app is very efficient in battery and data use as key features like finding train locations and schedules can work offline without Internet or GPS. The app-size is relatively small despite having a lot of information offline.
Seat Availability and PNR Status
Check seat availability and PNR status on the official Indian Railways website within the app.
